Hi!
These are the dependencies of this part of our project:

- Python 3

- Modules:
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - scipy
You can install them via $ pip install [--user] numpy matplotlib scipy
(You need pip for this purpose)

- Yet more modules:
  - tkinter (required by matplotlib)

It's OS dependent we can't help you there.
